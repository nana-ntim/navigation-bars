# Nagigation Bar Training

### What Is This?
- This repository is for all the nagivation menus i've made and understood how to build.
- This could be either from youtube or custom made to process different layout systems

### Can I Use This?
- You're more than welcome to use any of the projects i've made public
- This is for my personal training, so if it helps you, it's all yours

### Components
- The things I use for these projects differ, as it's just a compilation of different designs
- It's up to you to find out what I used to build the individual nav bars here
- I'll do my best to use HTML, CSS and JS alone for now till it's updated again.

### Conclusion
- I create these projects for both my portfolio and technique building
- This means even if I use YouTube for a project, I understand it very well.
- I really hope this helps you too.
- Good luck!
